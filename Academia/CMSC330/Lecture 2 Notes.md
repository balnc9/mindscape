**OCaml Basics**
***Compiler***
- translates code from high-level to lower-level programming language
	- e.g assembly language, byte code, machine code
- converts code *before* program runs
- run compiled code to get output
- Compiler optimizes program
***Interpreter***
- the interpreter translates live while code line-by-line *live* - while the program is running
- we get output when the code completes

***What is a functional language?***
- defines computations as *mathematical functions*
- *discourages* use of mutable state
