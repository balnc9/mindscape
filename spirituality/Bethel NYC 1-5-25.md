Isaiah 61

Offering prayer asking for raises, bonuses, finding lost money, etc.? Asking for Jesus to provide????

False starts?

Jesus isn't born where kings should be born, he's born in a manger.

He embarrassed his parents for not coming so the them, but it was because he was with his father.

John baptized Jesus.

He breaks sabbath. Or does he?

He blasphemes. Or does he?

So many disqualifying things in the story of Jesus. Nobody needs a perfect start. Even Jesus didn't, but it still goes according to plan.

We aren't meant to just know the story of Jesus. But the nature of the story is so different than the dominant stories that we know in our lives. This story should change the way we think about lives and stories in general.

You can know aspects of the story, but not acknowledge the meaning. (Nursery rhymes)

Matthew 2: 1-13

Following a star is difficult because it's in the air, ambiguous, accuracy is impossible. Action is needed. When God wanted to show group of gentiles the greatest revelation, he didn't give them a plan or a map, he just gave them a star. He just gave them something to promote action. Just go, you don't need the roadmap, and a 26 step plan. Just follow the star.
