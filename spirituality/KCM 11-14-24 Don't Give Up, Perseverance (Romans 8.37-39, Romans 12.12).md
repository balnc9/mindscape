“It's not the size of the dog, it's the size of the fight in the dog”

- Do we believe this in terms of our faith/relationship with God?
- Oftentimes endurance can be presented as “Just fight harder”

Romans 8 is a great passage to memorize:

- Talks about how creation is groaning, how this world is not the way it's meant to be. Because of sin, suffering, and the brokenness of this world.
- We live in a creation that is groaning.
- So much in Romans 8, talks about how God saves us before even time began. He knew us individually and will lead us to glory. As children of God, we are given the holy spirit to minister to our hearts.
- Talks honesty of how broken this world is, because not how it is supposed to be. God will do something about it.

Romans 8:35 “Who shall separate us from the word of Christ?”

Rejoice, be patient, and be prayerful

- Rejoice because we know that God has a plan, and we know Gods plan. Not matter what happens we have a reason to rejoice.
    - Can you still rejoice if your life doesn't go to plan?
    - The longer you live life, you will see how much suffering exists, how holy God is and how sinful we are. How much we need God’s grace.
- Maturity is knowing how gracious God is, within a world of suffering and sin.

We should be confident in God and in his plan over our lives. We should rejoice in hope and be patient. Generally bitterness will replace rejoice in times of suffering. So often in the darkest times, what makes it worse is not rejoicing. The darkness grows on itself.

Be constant in prayer because we know that God is present with us. Be able to be prayerful in the hardest of times. This is the mark of a true Christian.
