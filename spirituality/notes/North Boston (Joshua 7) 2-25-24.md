Social Sin - There are two types of sin in Hamartiology (The study of sin in Christian theology).

- Individual Sin: the thing everyone talks about (Martin Luther, etc) the reason we are not Catholic because the 95 Theses - not through liturgy or preists, its between us and God. Western theology has explored this topic thoroughly. We over emphasize our relationship with God as an individual (quiet time, solo stuff) and underemphasize liturgy and collective church.
- Within sin, there is also a social element. When the people of God sin, it would fall on everyone’s head. It would not just be something that is individually wrong, it falls on everyone. Which is very real and valid, and another layer often referred to more in scripture.
    - Although one person acted unfaithfully, all of Israel is held liable and all of Israel suffers punishment for the same person.
    - This concept doesn’t really exist in our current culture, but it is deeply biblical. “It falls on us all.” (North Boston 2/25/2024, Jane)
    - The implication of community, liturgy, etc. Is that the collective model of faith, Grace and sin is a mandate. We are all held liable for one another. Because we are the body. This is one of the most biblical things, there is no option. It is a mandate.

If there is one community, if we are all in one church, and we hold membership in a specific larger church, one part, one faction is suffering unjustly, it is our responsibility not because the justice of God is in our nature, but because it is social sin to oppress the widows and the orphans of our age. This is what Micah talks about

But isn’t this a little silly? Should we really be held accountable for others actions?

- In God’s view, faith, life, sin aren’t separated / isolated by individual experiences, we are viewed as a collective body, as a collective faith, where one person’s actions affect the whole.
    - In Joshua’s time, Achan’s disobedience was more than an individual sin in the act of theft - it was a betrayal of the covenant relationship that defined Israel as a people set apart for God. By taking for himself what was devoted for God, Achan weakened the community’s integrity and trust in God’s provision. His sin damaged Israel as a whole.
    - Accountability for the collective body’s sins is a natural outcome of our bond as a spiritual family. Just as one member of the body impacts the whole, our choices impact one another. Faith isn’t just personal (It is personal, but it is also…) COMMUNAL, SOCIAL. We are called to share each other’s burdens and uphold one another.
