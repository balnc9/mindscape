“And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,

We can all agree that our personal faith matters.

But some christians have a hard time seeing that it's more than that. “Isn't it my own faith that saves me in the end?” Why do we need to spend the entire year focused on community? Why not just one sermon? Why do we need one another so much?

Context of letter to the Hebrews: Original audience (Christian community) was facing persecution because of their faith and as a result, some walked way from Christ. This letter was to give hope and a reminder to stay strong and keep hope in God.

Context: (Hebrews 10:32-34)

One of the things they must practice to remain faithful and strong in their relationship with God is to “stir up one another…not neglecting to meet one another but encouraging one another”

There are a few things that we have in common with the people in Hebrews

- We struggle with our faith from time to time.
    - There is a way for us to remain strong: To stir (provoke, incite) up one another to love and good works.
    - Love your god with all your heart soul strength and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself
    - Feed those who are hungry, clothe those who are poor, help those who are weary.

It is more blessed to give than to receive. It is more joyful to help and love and do good works than to receive.

You are not being a Christian if you are not loving on your neighbors. If you do not teach, you are not a teacher.

If you do not do good works and do what God has called you to do, you may not truly be a Christian.

“What good is it my brothers if someone says they have faith but not good works…”

(Jas 2:14-17 & 2:26)

_**Matthew 26 The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak**_. Solution is the church, he gave us the church so that we can provoke one another to good works. Sometimes we need someone else to help us and get us back on our feet.

Ecclesiastes 4:9-10

Galatians 6:1-2

Hebrews 3:13

Why did the author of Hebrews use the word provoke or incite?

Our goal isn't to tell them we care about them, and to say it's all going to be ok.

Encouragement doesn't always lead people to action. Our ultimate goal isn't to sugarcoat and encourage, but to PROVOKE them to get back on their feet and get back in the race. Sometimes we need more than words of kindness. Don't be rude, but make sure you help one another to actually live how we are called to live.

How?

- Meet together as often as you can. show up to Oikos , PNP, etc.
