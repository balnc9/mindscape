Can our love for Jesus be too extravagant?

Can we ever love Jesus too much?

Is there a limit to how much we should love Him?

Which character in this story can you relate to more? Judas or Mary?

The disciples took Judas’ stance

to Mary her gift wasn't extravagant, because extravagance is in the eye of the beholder. He was worthy of the gift and much more.

Something is only extravagant to us based on our circumstances, if it's out of our budget or out of our price range it is extravagant.

How much is too much? Depends on who you ask.

If my love for Jesus never causes the people around me to question me, maybe I'm playing it too safe. Your love for Jesus should not be socially acceptable or logical. How far are we willing to go and how crazy are we willing to seem for Jesus?

How can we be like Mary?

- The one we need to look at to be like Mary is not Mary, but Jesus.
- The way Mary was able to have extravagant love for Jesus was because she knew about Jesus’ love for Mary.
- The real extravagant love wasn't Mary to Jesus, but Jesus to Mary. He loves Mary so much that he died for Mary and died for all of us. We need to grow in our understanding of his extravagant love for us. 1 John 4:19
