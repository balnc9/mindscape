God established Eve as a “suitable helper” in Genesis 2:18

- **The relationship**
    
    - The word ezer kenegdow expresses a relationship of equals, not subordination. It implies that each gender has qualities that the other lacks, and that they depend on each other.
- **The creation**
    
    - God created Eve from Adam's rib, intending for her to be equal to him in power and strength.
- **The role**
    
    Eve was not created as a slave, but as a partner and helper in subduing creation
