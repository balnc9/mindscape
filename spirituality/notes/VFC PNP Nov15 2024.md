John 15

Proverbs 15:29

1 Pt 3:12

- Jesus would be our problem. We can be forgetful. Do we think about things in ways that don't reflect the gospel.
- Pray for forgiveness. Repent. Pray that the spirit of God would help us vividly remember of his grace and sacrifice.
- The scripture tells us that when we ask for forgiveness, There will be forgiveness because God is just.
