Fruit of the Spirit : Love

Galatians 5:22-25

What does Love free us from?

- Fear which leads to self-centeredness

Almost everyone has a fear of something. Heights, darkness, etc. One of the most common and paralyzing fears is the fear of rejection. Fear of man, which prevents us from doing many things in life.
