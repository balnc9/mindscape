Ephesians 2:1-5

You were dead in your sins, there was no hope for you, nothing you could have done. You were consumed by your sin and just waiting to be consumed. We were destined for Gods wrath and to be judged by our sin. A hopeless destiny.

(4) - “but GOD, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ…”

He wrote the most powerful thing.

- “but GOD”

This is what it means

It doesn't matter your situation, how big or small your problem is. Before the mercy love and grace of GOD, they are nothing but situations that can be easily turned by GOD. Not situation is too strong that God cannot change it and overcome it. When God steps into the picture, everything becomes trivial to the power of God. Regardless of your week, your month, your year, know that God is much bigger than your problems. Practice this tonight.

- Let the phrase “but God” be constantly on your lips and a part of your thought process.
- x, y, z, But God will save me

This is the most powerful thing you can say because you have been saved and delivered by God.
