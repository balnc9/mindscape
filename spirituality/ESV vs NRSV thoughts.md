One of Jane’s reasons for switching is beacause

Verse 22-33 is disattached from verse 21 in some translations (ESV, presumably). Ephesians 5: 21 coats and covers the entire passage. Mistranslation

“Be subject to one another out of reverence for CHRIST”

“After a lot of historical digging and understanding of the impetus and birth of the ESV, I’ve determined that the NRSV is a more apt translation to refer to. I can go into this more for sure, but at its core, the ESV and the RSV are not very different- except that the ESV and its translations have been modified by a preexisting ideology. This is because the ESV bought the RSV and altered it.

Because I appreciate the translation style that stays close to the original language, and because of the historical context, I find the RSV and NRSV to be a stronger translation overall!” (Jane)
