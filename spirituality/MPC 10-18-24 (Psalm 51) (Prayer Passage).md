_**Psalm 51: Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God**_

Note: To the choirmaster, a Psalm of David, when Nathan the Prophet went to Him after he had gone into Bathsheba

This refers to the events of 2 Samuel when david sinned in adultery, and tried to cover it up without repentance, and thought he covered it up, but was confronted by Nathan the prophet and repents.

51: 1-2

David’s plea for God’s mercy. Not because he deserves it or earned it, but through God’s pure, undeserving, love for us. David’s justification for his forgiveness isn’t through anything that he has done, but because of God’s steadfast love, and abundant mercy. A steadfast and constant love. - Prayer for mercy that you would be overwhelmed by his mercy and that he would have mercy on you according to his steadfast and abundant love. Only by his blood and for our sin.

51: 3-6

David is crying out to the LORD for his wrongdoings and for his sin. (3) “For I know my transgressions.” He knows that this isn’t a first time thing and that he lives his life in wrongdoing and sin. During the times between his sin and his confession, David could not escape the reality of sin. David realizes that GOD has been with him throughout everything and through the struggle and the hardships. Take the time to pray and lay it all down before God, confessing whatever has been heavy on your heart and whatever guilt has been weighing continually.

51: 7-12

David looks to God for spiritual and moral cleansing. There is a degree of confidence that David has in God. In the midst of his brokenness, David believes in God. David doesn’t ask to change his heart, but to Create a NEW heart, something that only God can do. A humble reliance on God., Pray for restoration through the blood of Jesus, and the creation and renewal of a new spirit and a new heart in God. Cry out to him to create a clean heart and a right spirit. Rejoice in the brokenness because it is all for Him.

5:15-19

David closes the chapter with the 4 verses here. Talking about heart posture and how we ought to live our lives of worship. You will not delight in sacrifice or pleased in a burnt offering. How many times did David offer sacrifices at Gods altar with periods of unconfessed sins. How many times do we stride to serve for God without confessing to our sins. God doesn’t want anything but for us to serve Him with whole hearts, to cling to him.
