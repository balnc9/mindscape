_**The Gospel Community**_

One of the first things that Jesus did was create a small group, a “team” of his disciples. It could have been easier for him to do everything on his own; his disciples were uneducated (young) and uncooperative sometimes.

- They constantly misunderstood his teachings and strayed from his ideals.
- Also, all of his disciples were very different from one another in every way: politically, socially, economically, personality-wise, etc. If not for Jesus, they would not even be in the same room.

But Jesus for 3 years lived with these people.

This community sounds a lot like OUR community here: maybe even less of a mixed bag than Jesus’ community. Sometimes we think that it's fine to walk through life without others walking with us.

- We have this tendency to want to be around people that are similar to us.

Church brings in people from all different stages of life and all different types of communities.

It's not wrong to want to be around people that are similar to us, but _if that is your basis for choosing a church, you will never find a lasting community which will bear fruit_. This is because people's hobbies and interests change. And someone who looks like you on the outside may look different on the inside. What happens when you don't share your old similarities that brought you together?

- Jesus’ different disciples later became the closest brothers, and fought together not against one another.

M 10:1 “And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority”

If we try to form a community without Jesus at the center, this community will not last forever. If we want any community that will bear fruit and transcend any common interests, we need to build a community with Jesus at the center.

So… how? Is church not that community?

1. Jesus needs to be at the center of our own individual lives first.

When Jesus became the center of the disciples’ lives, their bonds became stronger. Before you seek a gospel centered community, Christ must be at the center of your life.

1. Jesus’ community is marked by the mission of Jesus

Make Jesus known. All the disciples had their own values and things they wanted from Jesus, but when the mission of Jesus became their mission. that's when they began to grow. Because they all wanted the same thing. They wanted Jesus to be known and worshipped and loved and feared.

Build the community we want on strong roots and a firm foundation.
