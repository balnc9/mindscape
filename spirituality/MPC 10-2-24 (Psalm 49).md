Ask for wisdom, pray to Him and pray to not fall to temptation, to look to him to find joy and happiness. Grant us your wisdom, speak to us.

The prosperity of this world and our riches and temporary things do not matter. God is above it all, He brings us value. While the wicked perish, we look to Him with hope. That in the end, he is our God and we are his people. Keep hope that at the end, he will save us.
