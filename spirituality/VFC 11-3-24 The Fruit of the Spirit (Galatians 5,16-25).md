Why should I change? Maybe I can revisit this later when I have more time.

- The fruit of the spirit is not an add on. It's not something that's nice to have but not necessary. It is absolutely necessary and a product of your faith.

We are not saved by our good works, but how do you know if you are saved? How can you know that the holy spirit is in you?

Overview of the FOS

Pretext

- The fruit of the spirit is essentially about freedom. Not about being a nicer person, or being more loving, kind, etc. It might help you, but the fruit of the spirit is about being free from the desires of the flesh.
    - James 1:15
- Paul references the fruit of the spirit as a singular, not a plural. This is to signify the unity of the 9 virtues of the fruit of the spirit. They are not separate, but they make up one fruit. You cannot have one without the rest.

One of the reasons people lack self control is because they don't have true joy.

- “You can't have true self control without having joy”

The goal isn't to try and collect these virtues and try to get as many as we can.

How do we begin to grow the fruit of the spirit?

- If we live by the spirit, then let us also keep in step with the spirit
- Persistently reading his word
- Remind ourselves that the flesh no longer has control over us.
- The holy spirit gives the growth that it needs.
