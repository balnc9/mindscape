Rest In Christ

Matthew 11:25-30

- “Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”

It is not what goes in your mouth that makes you unclean, but what comes out of your mouth.

What does it mean to come to Him?

v29 - “Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls”

What is our burden? What is Jesus’ burden here?

It's his teachings and commandments.

When Jesus is saying take my yoke

- - He's not saying we split the burden half and half, he's saying I will take the burden and you just learn from me and come along with me.

Just reading your bible, going to church, etc is not what it means to rest in god. It's about following Jesus and his way of life, not about momentarily stepping away from our busy lives to be with God for a bit. It's about an entire lifestyle change. When Jesus becomes your everything.
