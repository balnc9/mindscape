James is the writer of this letter, presumably a leader in the church by the authority and tone of his speech. From the letter, we can gather that James was a powerful man and a leader in the church. He was a man who loved what was right and good. Even those who did not believe in Christ thought well of him. This was especially true about those who were poor, because he helped those who were poor and did what he could for those who suffered wrongs. In that way, he showed his trust in God and Jesus Christ. In all this, he was a man of peace and wisdom.

Context:

A large number of the Christians had left Jerusalem, but the apostles and leaders of the church did not go, so these Christians no longer had the daily contact with their leaders. James wrote to help and encourage them to live as Christians should.

What Christians believe must affect what they do. This is the main subject of his letters; they should apply their trust in God to the problems that they have. Real faith must be active. That is the key to what he wrote. Faith that does nothing is not real faith, and faith without good works is dead, so he says.

The Structure of James Chapter 1

- Greeting from James 1:1
- Testing builds character 1:2-4
    - Trials can be a real test of trust in God. But when we meet them with the right attitude, they can prove or disprove the quality of our faith. They know that God is the Lord of all, and that he will help them. God has allowed the trials to come, so that Christians can find joy in their trials because they know that they can overcome them.
- God gives wisdom to those who ask in faith 1:5-8
    - v5 “If any of you needs wisdom, ask God for it. God is generous. And he is ready to give to all that ask. He will never say that you are wrong to ask. He will give you what you need.”
        - All who feel the need of God must ask God for it. He will answer the prayers of those who ask for it, but they must _believe_ that he will give it.
        - God does not blame those who ask. They need never be afraid to ask too much or too often. God is always ready to give to them all that they need, and he is never angry with them for their lack of wisdom. He is so often much more ready to give it to them than they are ready to ask for it.
- Poor and rich Christians 1:9-11
- Temptations and sin 1:12-15
    - Those who overcome the trials of our flesh and this life experience real joy, because they have proved their trust in God. God will give this “crown of life” to those who love him and trust him.
    - v13: When we fail, we naturally like to blame others, because we don’t want to be responsible for our own failures. However, pinning the blame on God is incorrect and faulty. “Let no one say when he is tempted ‘I am being tempted by God’ for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one’”
        - God does not tempt us, it is the desires of our flesh that tempts us. This is because God cannot be the cause of the evil things that men do. Evil things cannot come from God, there is no moral weakness or fault in him.
    - God does test people but not in the sense of these verses, not in the sense of temptations. He tests people to prove them, not to set them up for failure.
