_Practical Warnings_

_**6:1-5**_

If you are trapped by your previous commitments ( “if you are snared in the words of your mouth” ), Plead with the people of your commitments. “_Give your eyes no sleeps and your eyelids no slumber; save yourself…”_

You shouldn't be fine with abandoning your words and previous commitments, you should care and it should show.

6:6-11

_“Go to the ant, O sluggard, consider her ways, and be wise. Without having any ruler… she prepares her bread in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest”_

The ant fulfills its duties without being told to, without anyone to rule over it and command it to do so. Not because the ant wants to, but because it is what the ant must do. The ant works hard “in the summer” or when the work must be done.

_“A little sleep… a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you…”_

Solomon imagined the lazy man, the sluggard saying this “a little sleep, a little slumber”

- “Sleep is the defining characteristic of the sluggard, for him the love of sleep is pure escapism- a refusal to face the world.” (Waltke)

6:16-19

The seven abominations to the LORD

1. “Haughty eyes” - a proud look
2. “A lying tongue”
3. “Hands that shed innocent blood”
4. “a heart that devises wicked plans”
5. “feet that make haste to run to evil”
6. “a false witness who breathes out lies”
7. “one who sows discord among others”
    1. Presented as the result of the previous six, the highest of the abominations that the LORD hates.
    2. A mischief maker, instigator maybe?
