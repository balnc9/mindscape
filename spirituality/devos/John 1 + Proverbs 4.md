John 1

(Study source: [https://www.easyenglish.bible/bible-commentary/john-ma-lbw.htm](https://www.easyenglish.bible/bible-commentary/john-ma-lbw.htm))

John 1 is like a prologue stating the main themes of the gospel: life, light, truth, the pre existence of Jesus Christ. Slightly poetic in structure, with _staircase parallelism_ (in which the last word of a sentence/phrase becomes the first word of the next) and… John 1:19-51 is a testimony of John the Baptist about the Messiah and Jesus’ self-revelation to the first disciples. This is the introduction to the proper gospel and introduced the major theme of testimony.

- J 1:1-2 - “Word” here means Jesus. So Jesus preceded all things and existed before he was born to Mary. He was with God the father even when God created the world.
- J 1:3-4 - God created everything by the Word, so Jesus caused everything to exist, and gave everything LIFE, as the opposite of death. When we believe in Jesus as our savior and Lord, he gives us eternal life, meaning that even death shall not part us from his presence and from the Holy Spirit. This means that we will live in heaven with him. But,

1. We must believe that Jesus is God’s Son
2. We must obey him
3. We must believe that he died on our behalf. All of us deserve a punishment because of our sins. But Jesus took on this burden of punishment for us.
4. We must confess our sins to God.

Through this, we receive eternal life.
