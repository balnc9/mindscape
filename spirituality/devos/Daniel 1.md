Called by Jane a “puzzling book” because the first part of the book will read like Kings, and the second part will read like Revelations

Daniel 1 holds the baseline context to the beginning of the story told in Daniel

The backdrop of this chapter is that Israel falls. After Israel, Judah falls to Babylon. (Both stay fallen until the modern era - 2+ millenia, so one of the biggest moments in all of the history of Israel, on their last legs) This book is all about rulers and kings.

The main idea of Daniel is that God is our one true king. God orchestrates all true things.

The book of Daniel is all about how to live as a believer in world that has completely fallen to the mercy of human empire.

Israel suffers a crushing defeat. This outwardly and inherently challenges the reality of their God. Very easy to imagine that people were criticizing and judging them.

- So why in verse 2 does it say “And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God…”
- There is a paradox here. If God allows Israel to fall…
    - “God is not strong enough to protect his people from Babylon”
    - “God let it happen”
- Which do you choose? Is our God someone who could punish?
    - In order to understand the book of Daniel, you must wrestle with the concept of a good God, who has allowed tragedies like this to happen. It should’t jeaporadize your faith, but without asking yourself these types of questions, your faith might be a scared faith.
        - The reality is Israel have fallen again and again, and forgotten time and time and time again about God.

v3/4

Interesting move by Nebudchadnezzar, like a move of propoganda. For example, when Hitler wanted to take over German thought, he took advantage of the easily influenced, passionate, and impressionable, like children / young boys. So Nebudchadnezzar calls for the young handsome exceptional men, because those are the ones with INFLUENCE.

- Among these men are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah from Judah.
    - Chaldean = Babylon
- Nebudchadnezzar is no fool. He knows that the best way to usurp a nation is taking over cultural influence. He changes their names to Chaldean names as an attempt to take over the Israeli culture. In the midst of that, they receive royal treatment (Somehow ?)
    - The best way for any kind of power to try and take complete ownership of who you are is to change your name, put clothes in your back and food in your stomach, and to re-shape your identity.

This is not so far from us. We may not be oppressed by a nation usurping our nation, but the modern world has done these things to us.

v8

The idea of indoctrination is tried and true. There is no need to look to Germany, Korea, or America to figure out how people turn out the way they do.

Daniel decides to take a more active role in his life, and say “I can’t eat this”

Daniel is powerless. He is only able to reject any other form of indoctrination, but he makes this one feeble and small request, saying he can’t eat the food.

Indulgence is something to be mindful of. Daniel does not want to lose anything else from his identity.

God gives the 4 the ability to stand out and have influence.

God is on the move, he has a plan, regardless of the outcomes of the world. We need to stop making predicated opinions and judging whether God is just or not based on small outcomes of events of this world.

God’s plan is for his people. Suspend judgement and stop looking at what we see with our eyeballs and calling out where God is and isn’t. There is no pillar of fire, no voice, but there is a miracle. Just enough to get Daniel’s foot in the door, and a way to worship God, no matter the medium.

Yes God is complicated, and sometimes bad things happen to Gods people. Sometimes the most vulnerable of Gods people find themselves in even worse situations. But he is still here, and still working. Just like the Israelites, so many times we continue to fall on our own sword. God has not left us, not forsaken us.

What does it mean that God is in control?

It means that we cannot turn a blind eye to how we have been indoctrinated to the ways of this world. When you learn x y z, have you even considered what it looks like to be an Israelite in this world. **What does it mean to be in this world but not of this world to you?**

Daniel will not compomise his God for the world.

Who are you? Who is the God that you serve and why do you serve him?

Can you say

- “Yes i am confused and yes this does suck but while i am wrestling, and struggling, I will not give up on God”

What does it look like to be a believer to you?

When you experience pushback, will you bend like a reed or will you continue to walk in favor?

Will you walk by faith and not by sight?

Look to scripture. Hold faith.
