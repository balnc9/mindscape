Proverbs 10:1 to Proverbs 22:16 is the second major section in the Book of Proverbs. This section contains 375 short poems. Most poems have two lines and each poem is one verse long, so 375 verses. Each is called a ‘proverb’

Solomon did not separate the proverbs into groups, they change from one subject to another. However, their order _does_ matter. Solomon uses a natural order, similar to a conversation, where one proverb might explain or respond or contrast a previous one. Together, they form something of a conversation.

Because of the structure, you cannot split these proverbs into smaller sections. All of Proverbs 10:1 - 22:16 belong together.

_The Proverbs of Solomon_

10:1 “_The proverbs of Solomon, A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother”_

It does not matter your age, gender, intelligence, if you are Wise, you respect God. ‘Respect God! This is the first lesson in wisdom. Know God! This is intelligence’ (Proverbs 9:10)

Fools live for their own pleasure, which also refuses God’s wisdom. Other people _will_ suffer because you are a fool, in this verse, that person is his mother.

Proverbs 10:12 “Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses”

Love covers all that is wrong. When we love someone, we try not to think about their mistakes or their past / wrongdoings. Our love covers their mistakes, so we don’t think about their errors.

God loves us. He sent Jesus down to die as the ultimate punishment and sacrifice for our sins. Because of this, God forgives us. He doesn’t simply cover our evil deeds, but ‘take(s) our evil deeds away’ (Psalm 103:12)

Proverbs 10:19-20

“When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent. The tongue of the righteous is choice silver; the heart of the wicked is of little worth”

If someone says many things, then he will also say evil things. There is wisdom in silence, a good mans words are valuable. An evil man’s desires are worth nothing.

Other people can benefit from my own wisdom. Other people will suffer if we refuse his wisdom.

Solomon is not saying that we should not speak, but to avoid speaking too much. If we want to help people and love on them, you need to listen to them also and understand their problems. Then, we can pray for them and advise them and take them to someone who CAN help.

Sometimes we care with our words or actions, but best of all we we care with presence and being there with the sad person.

(20)

If we serve God, our words will help others. If our words are valuable, we should use them wisely. We should use them:

- to encourage other people
- to sympathise
- to help people

An evil man wants evil things, this is why his desires are worth nothing.
