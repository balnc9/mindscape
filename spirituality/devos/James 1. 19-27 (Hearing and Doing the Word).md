(See [[James 1 - Testing of Your Faith]] for _context_)

19: “…let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.”

- Be ready to hear, ready to listen, and God will guide you. Listen when others speak and understand them. Someone that talks too much won’t be able to notice and understand others.
- Proverbs 10:19-20 (Remembered from [[Proverbs 10]]
    - _“When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent. The tongue of the righteous is choice silver; the heart of the wicked is of little worth”_

21 (NRSV) : “_Therefore, rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls”_

- Rid yourself of sordidness (state of being dirty/unpleasant) before you can
- The word of God is like a seed. It requires soil to grow in. It takes root if they receive it, and will grow to change them and others to be more like God. You must allow the word of God to have its full effect, this soul-saving power.

23: “_For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in the mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like”_

- The word of God is like a mirror because it shows us how we are really like. The man in this verse sees his own face in the mirror but forgets soon after. He does not obey the word of God.
- You must remain in the law and do what it says. LOOK to the word of God, STUDY it and THINK about it. God blesses you right now and promises a good future with no end.

Current prayers:

- Pride - Realized recently that I have a lot more pride than I initially thought. For a long time I thought I was humble and not as prideful as others, but I realized that my pride just manifests in a lot less noticeable ways than others. But either way, I realize my pride, and it’s something that I want to read up on and research about from a biblical perspective of it. I simply hide my pride with humor or maybe even fake humility.
- School - School sucks. I’m always tired and always have internships in the back of my head.
- Brought ellie nathan and ethan to vfc today. Hope they stay or have a good week otherwise.
