This poem explains wisdom, and the opposite of it, the purpose was to teach Solomon’s son to be wise and lead his nation.

Wisdom, depicted as a woman in this poem, invites guests over to her house for a meal.

- Wisdom chooses her ‘guests’ carefully. She doesn’t choose famous people or rich people or clever people, but Wisdom’s guests are ‘_simple people’._ People who are sinners, wrongdoers, the unwise. Wisdom wants to teach them and show them the right way, the way to God.

V6 “_Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight_”

- A person must turn from evil behavior. Wisdom says “Leave your simple ways, and live”
- We must trust in God. Wisdom says “walk in the way of insight” and to live wisely

V8 “_Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you”_

A wise man loves the person who corrects him. A wise man learns from the person who see’s the wise man’s errors. If you love that person who corrects you, you are truly wise.

V10

To be wise does not mean to be intelligent or clever. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight”

- To be wise means to fear the LORD, or to RESPECT Him.
    - God is more important and supercedes everything in our busy lives. Therefore, our decisions should be made from the counsel of God, we should think first about God. Will x,y,z honor Him?

The second woman _Folly_ is depicted as the opposite of Wisdom, as ‘The Foolish Woman’

Folly is too lazy to prepare a meal for her guests, or stand to invite them, she _simply_ sits. Instead of inviting people from the highest places of town (like Wisdom), she _sits_ at the highest places of town. Folly is not careful with her invitations to guests, she calls on the simple people that decide to be foolish.

The sad story of Solomon and his son (via EEB bible commentary) The Book of Proverbs hides a sad story. Solomon was a wise king for most of his life. When he became old, Solomon forgot his wisdom. He had many wives. His wives tempted him to serve false gods. He did not remember God, who gave wisdom to him. He served false gods. The real God was angry with Solomon (1 Kings 11:1-10).

Solomon wrote Proverbs 1:1 to Proverbs 9:18 for his son. He wanted his son to learn wisdom. Solomon tried to teach his son. Solomon’s son was called Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the king when Solomon died. Rehoboam never followed wisdom. When he became king, his first decision was to refuse wisdom. He refused to obey the advice of Solomon’s wise advisers. Instead, he chose advisers who knew nothing (1 Kings 12:1-19). Rehoboam’s first decision was a terrible decision.

Most of the people refused to serve Rehoboam. There was a revolution and a war. The nation split in two.

Solomon led a great nation. His nation was always at peace. His son, Rehoboam, led a small nation. Rehoboam was always at war (1 Kings 14:30).
