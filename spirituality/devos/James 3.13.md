[[James 1. 19-27 (Hearing and Doing the Word)]]

_Wisdom from Above (v13-18)_

True wisdom comes from above, (v17). Wisdom from above is

1. Pure - deliberately mentioned first. Wisdom from above is clean and without self-ambition/self interest.
2. Peaceable (Peace-making) - Wisdom from above brings people together and nearer to God, not instigating fights or bringing conflict, but rather, peace.
3. Gentle - Wisdom from above is fair and kind, knows the weakness of human beings and helps them. Does not insisit on its own rights, and quick to help and slow to blame / anger.
4. Open to reason - Easy to approach, and will listen to others.
5. Full of mercy and good fruits - Helps those who suffer, has sympathy for all those who are sad. Has pity and love to do good for them and all people.
6. Impartial - fair to all, shows respect for all people, makes no distinctions. Does not make actions out of prejudice, sure about what is true. Has good standards that does not change.
7. Sincere - honest, does not pretend or act a part, sincere in ALL that it does with ALL people. Does not work for its own benefit.

V18: “_And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.”_

A well known saying that James used. Those with wisdom are like seeds that grow up into a plant. The fruit of that plant is righteousness. And the soil in which it grows is peace. Peace means a right relationship with other people and with God.
