Proverbs 5: Warning Against Adultery

5:3-4 - “_For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil, but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword_.”

- Solomon wanted his son to hold onto discretion and knowledge, and that the lure of a woman would be the test and ultimately the contrast to his desired (taught) morals and values in this book. His discretion and knowledge would be tested by the enticements of an immoral woman.
- The “honey” and “oil” are meant to represent sweetness and pleasanty, and by extension, represent the temptations of morality.

5:4-6

- These verses talk about the end of falling for the enticements of the “forbidden woman”
    
    - “_Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol”_
        - Sheol is known as the afterlife where the dead go to reside, almost like a representation of Hell?
    - The path of the immoral woman lead to **death**. She promises to add life and happiness, but instead takes it away. The wise man will ponder her path of life.
- If the sexual immorality is desired out of a perceived impulse of love, maturity and stability would say, _“If I really loved this person I would not act against their interest and my own. I will reject this immorality because I do in fact love them and will express my love only in ways that would honor God and His people.”_
    
    - You should reject sexual immorality because if you really love someone, you should express that love in a Christ-centered way and a way that would honor God and his people.
- If the sexual immorality is desired out of desire for pleasure or adventure, maturity and stability would say, _“My desire for pleasure and adventure must not reign supreme in my life. Whatever good I may think would come of this, it is not good and will not bring good.”_
    
    - If the sexual immorality stems from a desire for pleasure, you should reject it because the desire for pleasure should not dictate your lifestyle. Real maturity and stoicism and stability would not allow pleasure to affect your choices.

5:7-14

“_Keep your way from her, and do not go near the door of her house, lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless”_

- Solomon did not advise his son to sit in the presence of this woman and test his ability to resist her, instead he advised him to _distance himself as the best defense._ Not even going near the door of her house.
- We must **remove** our **way far from her** not only in presence, but also in heart and mind. We must put away the pornography and enticements common to our day and work for a mind set on things above ([Colossians 3:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Colossians+3.1-2&t=NKJV), [Philippians 4:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Philippians+4.8&t=NKJV)).
    - Remove yourself from unholy sexual enticements such as pornography, etc.

5:15 - “_Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well”_

- Solomon is reminding his son that God had provided his wife for his sexual needs. Instead of neglecting what God has given, he should renew his gratitude and focus upon what God has blessed.
- Drinking water from your own cistern is referring specifically to Adultery, as stated in the header of this chapter.

_**Reflection / Prayer Notes**_

Honestly, I can’t say I gained much from this chapter in the traditional, practical sense that it was probably meant to be read in. I don’t have a wife, or a girlfriend, or partner. However, I would say that I struggle with lust. I pray that I could be departed from this mindset. This is one thing that has been on my mind for a while, and I hope that I can overcome this lifestyle. It’s just not sustainable and it stains God’s image that he has built me in. As stated in 5:21,

“_For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. He dies for lack of disciplene, and because of his great folly he is led astray.”_

This is an important reminder for any man dealing with the temptation of an immoral woman. It is human nature to think this sin may be excused if it is never made public. We often think that sin can be excused if it is undiscovered, so undiscoverable sin is the most alluring and dangerous sins, because they are seen as “risk free”.

Solomon reminds us that God sees all our ways, and before Him no sin is hidden. God ponders all paths.

Sexual immorality and lust are hidden sin that can be overlooked but it’s something that I want to work on before I think about entering and relationship. I want my relationship to be God-centered and I pray to God the father that my spouse will be someone who I can pour into. I pray for a spouse/partner who loves God and someone who will lead me in my faith. I pray for a partner that I can have intentional and productive conversations with, for someone I can truly love on, and truly admire, and truly find beauty in. I pray that God places someone in my life that I can learn from and that I can teach things to. I pray that God places someone in my life that truly loves the Lord and finds delight in praising, praying, and worshipping Him through various mediums.

I also thank God so much for putting me in such a blessed position where I can enjoy things of life. Right now, my roommates (Jiho and Kevin) are playing Overcooked with Mak and Emma. I thank God for placing me in a situation where I can even have friends and people to talk to. I thank God for my church, for my family, for my friends.
