Our fights and conflicts often come from a difference of our own desires, in other words, our pursuit of pleasure interferes with our relationships with one another.

We should live not for our own pleasures but to please God.

v4 - “Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God” (NRSV)

Attachment to this world brings us further from our attachment to Christ. Focusing on God and what he wants only makes us his friend.

By nature, our relationship with God is antithetical to our society and how we are expected to act. Because the way of the world is the way of man, and we are not meant to live in the way of man, but the way of God.

v5+6 - “Or do you suppose that the scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the spirit that God caused to dwell in us desire envy? But God gives all the more grace; therefore it says _God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble_”

God’s “jealousy” (v5 ESV) is a different kind of jealousy. His jealousy wants the best for us because he loves us.

The prideful are those who refuse to obey God, those who do not realise they need God, those who think they are fine without God’s love. So the proud sets himself against God.

The humble are those who know their own weakness, and know that they must depend on God.
