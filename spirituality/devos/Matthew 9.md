*Lessons*

*Matthew was a tax collector working for the Roman government, taking money from fellow Israelites*
People like him were hated, and many were corrupt. 

When asked why he ate with these types of people, Jesus explained that he is to be ministering to the sinners, and gives an example of doctors and sick people. Doctors are needed for the sickly and diseased, not the healthy. He also points out that his mission is not those who don't think they are sick. Quotes Hosea.
