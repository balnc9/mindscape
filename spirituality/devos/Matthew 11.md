Standout verse:
Matthew 11:28-30 "Come to me, all you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light"

This chapter occurs right after Jesus' disciples are introduced by name and are declared to be sent (apostles).
John the Baptist questions Jesus and whether he is truly the Messiah because of his actions, but Jesus tells Johns disciples to tell John what he has done, and reassures John of the miracles that he has performed and will continue to perform. This is a reassurance and speaks to our own lives that we should be faithful and confident that God is at work even when we don't understand it. 

Jesus calls punishment upon those towns that saw Jesus' miracles and do not believe, saying that there is more grace for the towns that have not seen Jesus and witnessed his miracles, but the towns that have seen them and still do not believe are to be brought down to Hades, rejecting them the final goal and eternal blessing of God.
