James describes people that deceive themselves. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says has dead faith and is deceiving themselves.
- Matthew 7 - Build your house with God as your foundation. Otherwise, that house will not stand strong when the winds come.
    God is Not interested in behavior modification, but in Heart Transformation. Let our compassion lead our actions. James wants to bring up not a different gospel, he's not promoting salvation by works, but he is making a point that genuine faith should produce real work, because faith bears fruit.
- Stop saying “I'll pray for you” but not actually pray. This is a sign of dead faith.
_**Dead faith**_: unproductive, fruitless, useless, ineffective. We are not justified by our works, but works prove our faith in a way. Good faith produces works. However, all works don't matter if they don't produce fruit by living it out.
- _“Many christians have a huge gap between their confessional theology and their functional theology”_
    - Many christian leaders are labeled as hypocrites, fake. That their lives do not show any fruit. Nobody is exempt.

Are we who we claim to be? What/who do we claim ourselves to be and do our lives point to that? Are those claims evident in our lives?

We are representatives of Jesus. Do people see Jesus in us? Do our everyday actions show Jesus’ love?

We live by a higher calling, a higher standard. Because we love Jesus, because we represent Him, people expect more of us. We are different, how we treat others, our choices, our words, etc. Because we represent his kingdom. Pastors shouldn't be seen as “radical” or “different”. We should all be like that.

Be the difference maker. It is not enough to sit and allow the narrative of hypocrisy continue. Hold others accountable as they would to you. Keep the church for whom we are supposed to be.

James gives 2 Examples of what it means to live by Faith.

1. **Abraham**: Large figure in the bible. Considered to be the “father of faith” Not a surprise that his name is mentioned here, because James is writing this to Jewish readers. James is trying to make a point by mentioning that he has his nickname Not because of his waiting for over 25 years for his promised son, but when God asked him to sacrifice his one and only son and he obeyed. This is what gave Abraham the label as the father of faith. It wasn't an easy decision, yet he did. Genesis 22: Abraham packed wood and took his son isaac to the mountain. Isaac had no idea, but Abraham had every intention to go through with the plan. He tells us that Abraham believed that God is able to bring his son back to life even if he was killed. It took a long time for Abraham's faith to mature. God wants us to go through that season to experience ups and downs, to learn things by doing things wrong. Abraham had serious sin issues, however his faith matured through numerous failures. This is what led him to garner the name “father of faith.” It's okay to be in that season of ups and downs.
2. **Rahab**: She is uneducated, has no social status, isn't even a believer. Why would James mention her? Seems like such a bizarre comparison. She heard of the stories of what God had done, and made a decision to follow him and put her faith in him. She made her decision out of a love for her family, Rahab needed to choose whether to give into the fear of the Lord or the fear of the guards in Jericho. She hid spies and put her life on the line to save others out of Love. Rahab joins the lineage of David, one where Jesus will finally be born. A very unexpected person joins the lineage of Jesus because of her acts of faith. Faith and action looks different. He isn't expecting us to live up to other people's expectation, but how God is calling us.

To Ruth, living by faith meant showing love to her mother in law. To Jeremiah, faith meant abandoning his position as an official, and putting his neck on the line. To Daniel it meant that he would have to worship God even if he would be thrown into the den of lions.

What about you? What would that look like in your life?

_**Four Aspects of Living a Faithful life**_

1. Painful: oftentimes doing the right thing hurts. It's called SACRIFICE, sacrificing yourself to put others ahead. Learn to humble yourself, to keep your mouth shut when you want to speak back, learn to love on others at the expense of yourself
2. Liberating: God desires to liberate us, he heard the cries of the Israelites and came to rescue them from the Egyptians. God sent Jesus to us to set us free and liberate us from the bondage of sin. When we submit to his command, we experience freedom
3. Joyful: Faith becomes fun when you experience his presence. Community can feel vibrant, with joy, enough to convict people towards serving. Don't act with a resentful heart. It should feel fun, no matter the medium. Everything will feel fun.
4. Powerful: Something we are missing in the church. We need to get our power and authority back. It's because we are not living in our faith. Living by faith gives us the power in our steps, that authority. It shouldn't be “listen to us” it should be “look at us” The way we speak, the way we act, should attract people, like how Jesus attracted others. Jesus’ authority and his actions attracted others (THINK JANE). God doesn't expect us to be perfect. But he wants us to be on a journey together.
