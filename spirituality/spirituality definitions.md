_**Epistle**_ - a letter that is meant for specific context and for specific people. The book of Ephesians is an Epistle for the city of Ephesus during it’s time.

_**Social Sin**_ - There are two types of sin in Hamartiology (The study of sin in Christian theology). Individual Sin: the thing everyone talks about (Martin Luther, etc) the reason we are not Catholic because the 95 Theses - not through liturgy or preists, its between us and God. Western theology has explored this topic thoroughly. We over emphasize our relationship with God as an individual (quiet time, solo stuff) and underemphasize liturgy and collective church. Within sin, there is also a social element. When the people of God sin, it would fall on everyone’s head. It would not just be something that is individually wrong, it falls on everyone. Which is very real and valid, and another layer often referred to more in scripture. Although one person acted unfaithfully, all of Israel is held liable and all of Israel suffers punishment for the same person. This concept doesn’t really exist in our current culture, but it is deeply biblical. “It falls on us all.” (North Boston 2/25/2024, Jane) The implication of community, liturgy, etc. Is that the collective model of faith, Grace and sin is a mandate. We are all held liable for one another. Because we are the body. This is one of the most biblical things, there is no option. It is a mandate.
